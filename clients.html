of 2009 through deployment in late 2012 ICON performed a full data project in
support of VRS installing the first phase of a new benefits administration
system. This data project used the full ICON methodology to assess, profile,
cleanse, transform, migrate, and reconcile data from the legacy systems to the
new benefit administration system. Beginning in January 2014 ICON was asked to
perform a second full data project at VRS as they developed the remaining
features of their new benefit administration system. This project is ongoing.

selected ICON Integration and Design to perform an initial data assessment
project to identify potential data issues. Upon receiving the report IPERS
engaged ICON Integration and Design to perform a full data project in support
of them moving from their legacy system to a new benefits administration
system. This data project began in April 2007 and concluded when IPERS went
live with their new benefit administration system in December 2011. This data
project used the full ICON methodology to assess, profile, cleanse, transform,
migrate, and reconcile data from the legacy systems to the new benefit
administration system. IPERS is a large statewide public pension system with
over 250,000 active and retired members and over 2,000 reporting employers.</p>
