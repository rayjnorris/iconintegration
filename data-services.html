                                        <p>This is a core service
offered by ICON. Over many years of performing this service for public pension
systems, ICON has developed a thorough and comprehensive methodology for
analyzing and profiling data. One component of the methodology includes a
repository of nearly1000&nbsp;Data Quality Check Points (DQCP). These DQCPs represent
the accumulated experience of identified data quality issues found during prior
engagements. By using these DQCPs it is not necessary to "reinvent the
wheel" at every new client. However, ICON understands that each client
will also have their own unique business rules and data quality issues in
addition to those that are common in the industry.</p>

                                        <p>To perform thorough data
cleansing it is necessary to first begin with data analysis and profiling. Many
public pension systems tackle data cleansing one issue at a time. As they run
into a data issue, that issue is addressed. We’ve seen clients’ use this
approach for several years, however, until a comprehensive data analysis and
profiling has been performed, data quality issues will continue to "crawl
out of the woodwork". In addition, due to the complex relationships found
in public pension data, sometimes certain data quality issues may not be
identified until some data cleansing has occurred. For example, a service
credit problem may not be known until wage reporting cleansing has taken place. The reports produced during analysis and profiling
become the input into the data cleansing process.</p>

                                        <p>Typically clients have
their data spread out over many data sources, but would prefer to have their
data integrated. For example, data problems exist when there are multiple
addresses stored in multiple locations for members. ICON is very experienced
with flat files as well as relational databases and understands the need for
data normalization. Another reason to integrate data is to build a database
that can be used for reporting and management information. Because pension
systems must gather and report certain data elements to their actuaries, it is
vitally important to have high quality data.</p>

staff needed to design the new system. Their time is valuable and project
management is more difficult when both activities are occurring at the same

in data project management. In many instances a contracted oversight/project
management (OPM) firm is also involved, with the client or OPM firm providing

to ensure effective integration of the data project within the PAS project and
to ensure effective coordination of all contracted resources.</p>

Our knowledge of their data as well as experience gained at other systems

existing routines that allow them to very quickly pull desired information out
of a database. We have deep experience in using a wide variety of software
